Concept Development,10,"This criterion attempts to measure your ability to use divergent and convergent design thinking processes, account for technical and causal relationships through systems thinking, and show awareness of cultural contexts and philosophical or ideological mappings through critical thinking."
Engaged with design process,10,"This grading criterion measures the physical expression of your engagement with the design process. It supposes that by applying your energy into completing these steps, that you are absorbing the causal relationship inherent in design methodologies, are identifying the biases of the process that impact work for the better and worse, and are learning that project outcomes can be more than the end result. By participating in a project design process, you are building towards mastering design process capabilities. In short, you learn to approach design strategically, and can better understand how concepts emerge."
Technical mastery,5,"This grading criterion measures your ability to quickly gain and apply necessary technical understanding. Working with new digital formats, following technical instructions, using digital and analog tools, and applying formal elements and principles of design can all be considered aspects of technical mastery. Often, learning resources outside of provided course content will need to be consulted to acquire pre-requisite knowledge and skills that may be lacking. Your ability to quickly and efficiently locate and absorb technical knowledge is essential for success after your studies. Consult with instructor where necessary."
