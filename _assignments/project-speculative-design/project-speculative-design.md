>"a shift from designing for how the world is ... to designing for how the world could be"
>
> —Dunne and Raby, "Speculative Everything"

For this project, you will create a **speculative design fiction**. You will design, model, texture, and render a set of three related images and critically reflect on how your images relate to the theme in a 150 word work statement.

You will develop your concept around some environment, structure, object, or experience that you find interesting or problematic, and re-imagine it as a fictional version set in the future. You will imagine it's purpose and how it differs from examples of current day. This fiction can be naturally occurring, manufactured, synthetic, biological, or a mix. Experiment with unexpected colors, materials, proportions, scales, and textures.

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, the application of [formal design principles](http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf), competent [rendering technique](https://www.lynda.com/Maya-tutorials/Creating-Product-Shots-Maya/160716-2.html?org=psu.edu), good [composition](https://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-Elements-tutorials/essentials-composition/633865/676339-4.html?org=psu.edu)practices, and will require the you lead to discussion about the kind of reality needed to make these objects possible and the importance of pursuing or not pursuing such realities.

## Production Methods
You will go through a variety of different project phases including:

  1. Object identification,
  2. ideation and concept development,
  3. modeling and texture map production,
  4. lighting,
  5. surface shader configuring,
  6. rendering,
  7. feedback and iterative improvement,
  8. color grading and finishing,
  9. and writing reflection.

## Constraints
- Use 3D tools to produce images
- **Three** separately rendered images
- All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset.
